Hi, I’m Buting (Burt) Xu, a Master student in Computer Science Artificial Intelligence at USC. In May 2020, I completed my undergraduate at USC, majoring in CS Game Development.

I love making games and I’m familiar with all stages of game development, with engineering being my strongest of course.

Besides game dev, I also have a strong interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
