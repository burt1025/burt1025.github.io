Split is a 3D multiplayer puzzle game where two players play as the same person but in two split realities. They can't see each other but through interactions with the world they can feel the existence of their counterpart. Players need to establish communication and cooperate to solve puzzles and finally merge their realities back into one. I'm the designer and engineer of Split.
